Regression Models Performance
Linear Regression

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.89
R² Score: 0.89
Random Forest Regressor

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.70
R² Score: 0.88
XGBoost Regressor

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3.03
R² Score: 0.91
Classification Models Performance
Logistic Regression

Accuracy: 0.92
F1 Score: 0.92

Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: 1.00 (perfect accuracy)
F1 Score: 1.00 (perfect F1 score)
Clustering Model (K-Means)
Cluster Distribution:
Cluster 0: 98 instances
Cluster 1: 12 instances
Cluster 2: 18 instances
KMeans Silhouette Score: -0.03 (indicating poor clustering quality, as negative values suggest that clusters may be overlapping or not well-defined)
Summary
The XGBoost Regressor performed best among the regression models, followed closely by Linear Regression.
The Random Forest Classifier showed perfect accuracy and F1 score in the classification task, making it the best performing model in this category.
The K-Means clustering results show some challenges with cluster quality, indicated by the negative silhouette score.
