Regression Model Evaluation
Linear Regression:
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6.37, indicating the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices is around 6.37.
  R-squared (R2): 0.699, suggesting that about 69.9% of the variance in house prices is explained by this model.
Random Forest Regressor:
  - MAE: 2.81, showing better performance than linear regression in terms of prediction accuracy.
  - R2: 0.944, which is very high, indicating a strong fit of the model to the data.
- XGBoost Regressor:
  - MAE: 2.83, slightly higher than Random Forest but still quite accurate.
  - R2: 0.911, also a strong fit, demonstrating that XGBoost performs well with this dataset.
Interpretation: The Random Forest model seems to be the best-performing regression model in terms of both MAE and R2 score, closely followed by XGBoost.

 Classification Model Evaluation
- Logistic Regression:
  - Accuracy: 0.692, meaning the model correctly classifies 69.2% of the samples.
  - F1 Score: 0.692, indicating a balance between precision and recall for classifying prices above or below the median.
- Random Forest Classifier:
  - Accuracy: 0.923, demonstrating high accuracy for price classification.
  - F1 Score: 0.923, suggesting excellent performance in distinguishing between high and low price categories.
Interpretation: The Random Forest Classifier outperforms Logistic Regression significantly, achieving much higher accuracy and F1 score.

KMeans Clustering
- Cluster Counts:
  - Cluster 0: 111 data points
  - Cluster 1: 12 data points
  - Cluster 2: 5 data points
- Interpretation: This clustering divides the data into three groups. Cluster 0 has the majority of points, while clusters 1 and 2 are smaller. Visualizing these clusters could provide insights into how different property characteristics group together.

Summary
Overall, the models perform well:
-Regression: Random Forest Regressor provides the best predictions.
-Classification: Random Forest Classifier achieves high accuracy in categorizing prices.
-Clustering: KMeans offers grouping, which could be explored further to understand property segments.
